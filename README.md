Sec68 G4 Changing Recycling Behavior
P7: Computer Prototype 2

Task:

The task for this prototype is for the user to find out how to recycle a particular item by using the data filters on the website.

Components:

We implemented a data filter that allows the user to categorically filter information about how to recycle items. This filter is different to conventional data filters (a handful of form inputs on a single page). Our view is that this filter enhances usability by allowing the user to filter through the data in multiple steps.

Platform:

The latest version of Chrome.

Design Summary:


Our design of the recycling information data filter is different to conventional filters in that it doesn’t use a handful of form inputs to filter data. Rather, it is a progressive filter that allows the user to sort through data categorically until they get to what they are looking for. The affordances of the filter are clear since it requires the user to simply click the picture that best represents the type of information they are looking for. We have also leveraged the principle of feedback by highlighting the item the user hovers over to make their selection absolutely clear. Visibility of where the user is in the search filter is also promoted by the breadcrumb links at the top of the page. These links not only depict where the user is in the search filter, but also allow the user to quickly jump back to a higher-level category if desired. Finally, conceptual models are reinforced by using graphics (as opposed to a normal form-based filter).

We attempted to apply all four graphics design principles described by Williams in our user interface: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. With the idea of contrast in mind, we chose to highlight the user’s filter selection when they move their mouse over a specific item. This allows the user to quickly determine what item he/she is about to select. For repetition, we used consistent sizing and presentation of the filter selections through various depths of filter level, as well as for the information pages that present the information the user ultimately seeks. For alignment, all selections are organized in a well-aligned grid format making it easy to quickly find the information sought.
