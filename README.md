Sec68 G4 Changing Recycling Behavior P6: Computer Prototype 1

Task:

The task is for the user to create a drop point, which is a location where the user as well as other members of the community can drop of their recyclable materials and have them taken care of collectively.

Components:

A data collection form that allows the user to input information on drop point location, recyclable items and specific date on which the drop point closes and the waste is recycled.

An external content integration component that takes in the address information from the form and displays the data on a map by utilizing a Google Maps integration.

Platform: The latest version of Chrome.

Design Summary:

Our the design on the create drop point feature is sleek, minimalistic, and clear. The site gives out the affordances very clearly to the user: that the sole task is the create a drop point. The forms are designed to be filled in a direct downward fashion so the user would easily follow. The design imposes some constraints to the user so that they can correctly perform the task, certain fields like end dates follow a specific format, and if a user has not filled out all the required fields, he/she will not be able to submit the form. The design gives direct and visible feedback to the userâ€™s input, after the user has filled out all required fields, the website directly guides the user to the completed state where all the filled information along with the map are displayed.

We attempted to apply all four graphics design principles described by Williams in our user interface: contrast, repetition, alignment, and proximity. With the idea of contrast in mind, we chose to make the title and navigation bars green and the current page white; this will allow the user to distinguish between the navigation and content components. For repetition, we used consistent font size and styling for our menu and form items, so users can easily tell which section each item belongs to. For alignment, we center-aligned both the form and map so they are nice to look at. Finally, to exploit the principle of proximity, we placed relevant information next to each other e.g. all the navigation buttons are next to each other on the navigation bar, and all the required form information and clustered together in a box.
