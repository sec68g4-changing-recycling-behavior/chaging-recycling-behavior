                        <h4><b>Aluminum</b></h4>
                        <p>This is a commonly recycled scrap metal.
                          You can find aluminum in your soda cans, discarded food wrap foils,
                          an entire screen door frame, or storm windows.
                          Check your air conditioning units and old mobile homes,
                          they will most likely have aluminum wiring.</p>
                        <h4><b>Brass</b></h4>
                        <p>It’s easy to find brass in your home.
                          Your air conditioning unit is a good place to start.
                          Other things such as door knobs, brass-plated crockery,
                          nd old bed frames are made from brass.
                          You can get up to *$1.10/lb for brass shells there.
                          Look for brass in old electronics’ wiring too.</p>
                        <h4><b>Steel</b></h4>
                        <p>Stainless steel is one of the biggest metals used for manufacturing
                          and is stable when it comes to pricing, always between $0.30-0.75/lb.
                          If you were renovating your kitchen, scrap your stainless appliances,
                          sinks, trays, and appliances made of steel.
                          Just make sure your material is not magnetic or you may get a lower price for it.</p>
                        <h4><b>Iron</b></h4>
                        <p>Don’t be surprised if we tell you that unused
                            patio furniture or your garden furniture is most likely made of iron.
                            Even appliances such as iron pans, lawn mowers, swings in your backyard,
                            and iron railings are acceptable as scrap metal.</p>
                        <h4><b>Copper</b></h4>
                        <p>After aluminum and steel, copper is the third most used metal in manufacturing.
                          Copper is a valuable metal found in your household plumbing,
                          statues or living room decor, appliances, kitchen sinks, pots old roof accents,
                          and electronic wiring.</p>
