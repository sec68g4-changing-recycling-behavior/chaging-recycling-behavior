                        <h1>How to Recycle Books and Magazines:</h1>
                        <p>While magazine subscriptions are on a recent decline and book sales are holding steady, 
                            it’s likely you have a stockpile of both these products on your coffee table, in your 
                            bookshelf or collecting dust in the garage. When you’re ready to clean them out, 
                            hopefully recycling is on your mind.</p>
                        <p>Both books and magazines fall under the category of mixed paper, which also includes 
                            catalogs and phone books. While mixed paper has a lower commodity value (and thus a 
                            smaller recycling market) than items like newspapers, office paper and corrugated 
                            cardboard, most paper mills in the U.S. will recycle mixed paper.</p>

                        <h2>Book and Magazine Recycling Preparation</h2>
                        
                        <p> 1.For magazines, you don’t need to remove anything from inside the magazine, such
                              as staples, the cardstock ads or even perfume samples. You can also leave the 
                              cover and binding.</p>
                        <p> 2.If the magazine came in a plastic bag, you’ll want to remove and recycle this 
                              separately.</p>
                        <p> 3.For paperback books, you can recycle the book whole, including the binding. 
                              For hardcover books, you’ll need to remove the cover because it has non-paper 
                              components.</p>
                        <p> 4.If either your books or magazines have gotten wet or the paper has turned tan 
                              or brown, they should be thrown away with your household trash, as there is no 
                              recycling market for this material.</p>
                        <h2>Book and Magazine Recycling Process</h2>
                        <p> Since both books and magazines are mixed paper, the first step in recycling is to
                            separate these products from cardboard, office paper and newspaper grades. The mixed 
                            paper is then baled and sent to a mill.</p>
                        <p> At the mill, there are machines called pulpers that introduce water and chemicals to 
                            break down the paper into fibers. Then, any ink and adhesive is removed and the paper
                            fibers start bonding together. Finally, the fibers are rolled and dried, then sent off 
                            to make new products. Because mixed paper fibers are smaller than cardboard or office 
                            paper, this paper is recycled into lesser-quality paper products, such as coffee filters, 
                            egg cartons and paper towels.</p>
