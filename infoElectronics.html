						<p>Small appliances like blenders and toasters are mostly composed of metal like steel, making them pretty easy to recycle, and also something you want to keep out of a landfill.</p>
                        <h3>Preparing your small appliances for recycling:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Unplug your appliance for several days before recycling to let it cool down.</li>
							<li>For microwaves or other heavier appliances (e.g., breadmakers), tie up the cord using either a twist tie or the cord itself (or tape it to the unit). The last thing you want is to trip while carrying an item that may weigh 25 to 50 pounds.</li>
							<li>If the item is still in working condition, consider donating it to a thrift store. While it’s not required that you clean appliances before donation, it’s certainly appreciated.</li>
							<li>If your appliance has removable parts not made of metal (such as the tempered glass or plastic blender jar), there probably isn’t a recycling market for those. You can remove these parts prior to recycling.</li>
							<li>Take your small applicance to a local recycling center. <b>Note:</b> small electronics should not be placed in your curbside recycling bin. Curbside recycling programs are not equipped to handle small electronics. Electronics placed in your curbside bin will be crushed by the compactor in the truck. Pieces of glass, plastic and circuit boards from your device will contaminate the other materials in the truck and may render those items un-recyclable.</li>
						</ol>
                        <h3>Preparing your large appliances for recycling:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Unplug your appliance for several days before recycling to let it cool down.</li>
							<li>In the case of older air conditioners, freezers and refrigerators, you’ll need to confirm whether the recycler removes Freon. If not, you’ll need to contact a professional for Freon removal.</li>
							<li>If you bought a new appliance and it’s being delivered, ask the company if it will haul away your old appliance. In many cases, the truck will accept multiple appliances for recycling even if only one is being delivered.</li>
							<li>If you’re getting rid of a still-working product that is less than five years old, consider donating it. Habitat for Humanity operates ReStore locations throughout the U.S. that sell building supplies to raise money for new houses, and they will often accept newer, working appliances.</li>
							<li>Tape any doors with masking or duct tape so they don’t fly open during transport.</li>
							<li>If you need to transport the appliance to the curb or a truck, use a dolly. Large appliances are far too heavy for one person to carry them. <b>Note:</b> large appliances are often featured in bulky waste collection programs, a special type of curbside recycling. You’ll need to schedule this collection with your local solid waste office, and specify what type of appliance you have to see if there are any preparation requirements.</li>
