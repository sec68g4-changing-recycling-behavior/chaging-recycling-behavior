                        <h2>Preparing your batteries for recycling:</h2>
						<p>Most of the batteries that are used everyday do not require any special preparation before recycling, however it is recommended that precautionary measures be taken when recycling certain types of batteries to reduce any risk of short-circuit.</p>
						<p><b>Primary Lithium "Button" Cell Batteries (non-rechargeable)</b><br/>
						Special consideration must be taken to ensure all primary lithium "button" cell batteries have their positive terminals taped prior to recycling. We recommend taping both the positive and negative terminals by simply placing a single piece of tape around the top and bottom of the button cell covering both terminal ends.<br/><br/>
						Button cell batteries are used in many applications such as musical greeting cards, watches and hearing aids.</p>
						<p><b>Other Primary Lithium Cell Batteries (non-rechargeable)</b><br/>
						Aside from the various button cell sizes, there are the more common AAA, AA, C, D and 9 Volt varieties. All of these batteries must have their positive terminals taped before recycling.</p>
						<p><b>All 9 Volt (Including Alkaline)</b><br/>
						9 Volt batteries are the type usually found in smoke detectors and alarm clocks. Simply place a piece of masking tape over the terminal ends to secure both the positive and negative terminals.</p>
						<p><b>Sealed Lead Acid Batteries (SLA)</b><br/>
						Sealed Lead Acid batteries are commonly used to power emergency lighting systems, UPS power units, remote control cars and vehicles. The sizes of these batteries vary depending on the application and each must have their positive terminals taped before recycling.</p>
						<br/>
						<h3>Curious about how batteries are recycled?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li><b>Alkaline batteries:</b> Alkaline batteries are made primarily of zinc, manganese dioxide and steel, all of which can be made into new products. The batteries are shredded to separate the steel casing from the zinc and manganese active materials.</li>
							<li><b>NiCd and NiMH batteries:</b> Nickel Cadmium (NiCd) and Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries include nickel, cadmium (in NiCd only) and iron. Cadmium is a hazardous substance that can cause serious bodily harm if not properly captured, so Retriev uses a pyrometallurgical process for component separation.</li>
							<li><b>Lithium ion batteries:</b> Li-Ion batteries typically consist of cobalt and copper and may have nickel, aluminum and iron. The batteries are processed through an automated crusher, which operates under a liquid solution to prevent fugitive emissions and to reduce the reactivity of the processed batteries. The result is a metal-enriched liquid and metal solids, which can be reused in new products.</li>
							<li><b>Lithium metal batteries:</b> These highly reactive batteries are pre-treated using a proprietary cryogenic process to lessen their reactivity and to allow for further processing. They then go through an automated crusher that results in metal solids and lithium-enriched liquid.</li>
							<li><b>Lead acid batteries:</b> These batteries primarily consist of lead metal and plastic casings. The lead plates are removed from the plastic casing using an automated physical separation technology; the lead is eventually reused in new batteries and the plastic goes to recyclers to incorporate into new products.</li>
