						<p>Recycling of light bulbs depends on the type of light bulb. See below for some useful tips with respect to recycling light bulbs.</p>
                        <h3>Commonly Recyclable Light Bulbs:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Compact fluorescent lamps (CFL):</b> Unlike incandescent and halogen light bulbs, CFLs (compact fluorescent lamps) contain small amounts of mercury. Because of the mercury they contain, CFLs should be recycled for safe light bulb disposal. Call your local recycling provider to inquire about a CFL disposal service. Many towns may also have specified drop-offs or hold recycling events for these products. Low energy light bulbs can be recycled at most recycling centers and they are also accepted at all Home Depot, IKEA and Lowe’s stores in the U.S., as well as many regional chains. <em>Tip: Put the CFL in a plastic zipper bag to prevent any mercury from leaking if it breaks during transportation. Don’t pack multiple CFLs in the same bag, as this will increase the chance of them breaking.</em></li>
							<li><b>Halogen lamps:</b> Halogen light bulbs are typically used as flood lights, and can be found outdoors as well as inside. They contain halogen gas inside the tube which holds their filament. Like incandescent bulbs, recycling programs do not commonly accept halogen bulbs. Halogen bulbs do not contain toxic materials, so it is safe to throw them out with your household garbage.</li>
							<li><b>LED light bulbs:</b> LED light bulbs contain no dangerous chemicals, allowing you to dispose of them in the same manner as incandescent bulbs and halogen bulbs. Before you toss your old LED bulbs in the trash, consider recycling. Most of the LED bulbs available today are made of materials which can be recycled. Call your recycling provider to confirm you can include LED bulbs with your household’s recycling, or look online for an LED light bulb disposal recycling drop-off.</li>
						</ol>
						<h3>Non-recyclable Light Bulbs:</h3>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Incandescent bulbs:</b> Standard (traditional, old-style light bulbs) should be disposed of in normal household waste. They cannot be recycled as with regular glass, as the fine wires in glass processing are very difficult to separate out and the cost to recycle these items is prohibitive.</li>
